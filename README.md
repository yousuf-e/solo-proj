Yousuf's Solo Proj

## users
- ecri 38
- gymgoers 
- chefs

## Ideas
- Class bulletin board
  - have users be able to input text, and it will generate a post it and put it on a bulletin board 
  - after some time, the post will be deleted (1 day)
- gym tips aggregator
  - users can upload new excercies/ edit current excercises for better tips
   - example: users can add a new pullup, or edit the current pullup to add cues for more alt activation
- **recipe sharing site **CHOSEN**
  - users would upload/recipes, and each recipe would be linked to a region. use google maps api for this

## Technical challenges i want to over come
1. auth
2. SQL backend 
3. good styling (CSS)
